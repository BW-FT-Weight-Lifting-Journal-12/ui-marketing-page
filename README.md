# UI-Marketing Page -> Weightlifting Journal
Convenient app that tracks your progress in order to help individuals achieve and preserve a way of life and a mindset unique to the roots of muscle build and weight loss

# Motivation
Other workout apps take a simple thing and over complicate it. We believe that a workout log should do just what it says: log your workout. We cut out all the complications by removing any unnecessary extras and make it quick and easy to use without getting in your way, or slowing you down.
